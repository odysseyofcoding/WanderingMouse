# WanderingMouse
Note: I have not refactored the code to work out of the box on everyone's device. The code is from 2020 and works only on Windows OS.

This project is inspired by Daniel Shiffman from the YouTube Channel "The Coding Train" and the P5.js community.

## What inspired me in general?
I watched a documentary about psychology that focused on achieving a better focus on the present moment. They showcased a device with a wandering light that you had to follow with your eyes. My example wanders in random directions, not really efficient, but you can tweak it to wander from left to right in order to achieve a relaxing effect.

## Why the pc mouse and not a wandering drawing?
I enjoy challenges, and one of them was to programmatically control the mouse.
## How to stop the program?
As long as the console is open and you can focus on it, you can shut down the program by pressing any key. If you lose focus, use the windows + tab key to switch to the console and then press any key.

## What is ODC.P5Sharp?
Currently, it is just a very small collection of P5 vector processing functions translated for C#. I created it specifically for this app.
<br/>
By the way, I will probably not add further functions to it. There might already be existing solutions by other authors with different project names. I have not searched for any existing solutions.

Feel free to copy and share the code and enjoy your mouse wandering.

Please do NOT use this code in any production environment. It is only meant for playing around and should only run on a virtual machine dedicated to fun and testing.
