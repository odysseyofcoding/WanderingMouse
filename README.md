# WanderingMouse
Note: I did not refactored the code to work out of the box on everyones device. Code is from 2k20. It works only on Windows OS.

A project inspired by Daniel Shiffman from the YouTube Channel "The Codig Train" and by the community from P5.js.

## What inspired me in general?
I saw a documentary about psychology. It was focused on how to bring the mind into a stage to have a better focus on the right here, right now. They showed a device with a wandering light where you had to follow it with your eyes. - My exaple wanders in random directions, not really efficent but you can tweak it to wander from left to right in order to achieve the relaxing effect.

## Why the pc mouse and not a wandering drawing?
I like challanges and one was to have the mouse programaticaly under control.
## How to stop the program?
As long as the Console is open and you are able to focus it, you can shut down the program with any key. If you lose the focus, use the window + tab key and switch with your keyboard to the Console and then press any key.

## What is ODC.P5Sharp?
Currently, it is just a very small collection of P5 Vector processing functions translated for C#. - I just made it for this App. -
<br/>
BTW, I will probably NOT add further functions to it. Maybe it already exists by an other Author with different project name. I did not scanned for any existing solutions.

Feel free to copy and share the code as well as enyoing your mouse wandering.<br/>

Please do NOT use this code in any productional environment. It is only for playing around and should only run on a virtual machine which is dedicated for fun and testing.
